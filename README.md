# Peaceful Adventure

The game was created as a final project for the "NCGD008: Practical Course on Managed Game Development" course at the Charles University in Prague.

There is also an itch.io page.
 
## Game summary

The game is a pixel art **top-down RPG** in which you are a hero **fighting** against skeletons in the **dungeons**. By clearing out a dungeon you get **rewards** which help you survive longer and be more effective in the combat, and experience points which you need to level up and improve the hero's characteristics.

**Controls**:
- **WASD** (or on-screen joystick) for movement,
- **J** (or on-screen sword button) for attack,
- **I** (or on-screen chest button) for inventory,
- **L** (or on-screen hand button) for interaction,
- **ESC** (or on-screen button) to return to menu.

Right now it is only a simple prototype utilizing basic 2D game mechanics (nothing special or innovative), unfortunately adding some structure (story, quests, ...) would require too much time and be already out of scope of the final project.


## Target platform

Both, but more emphasis on PC.
